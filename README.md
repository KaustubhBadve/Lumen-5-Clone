# Clone of Lumen5

This is a collaborative Project from Masai School in the Construct Week. We are 4 members of the team:

<b>1. Kaustubh Badve : Team Lead</b>

<b>2. Sai Kiran Arishanapalli</b>

<b>3. Umesh Yadav</b>

<b>4. Harshada Jagtap</b>

Firstly let’s know about Lumen5. Lumen5 combines powerful A.I. with a simple drag-and-drop interface to help you create professional video content in minutes.

## Challenges and hardships we faced:

During the project, we divided our work among ourselves and we played our part very well.

## Tech & Tools Used :

These are the technologies used in this project which are available below:

#### Lumen5 (Original Website)
#### Chakra UI (UI Styling Library)
#### For Frontend : HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, JS6, ReactJS
#### For database: Local storage
#### For authentication: Masai Api Mocker

# Functionalities we made:
## Landing Page :
The landing page consists of various templates for video making. Users can hover on the given template video and preview it. Users can see filtration according to the type of video template.

## Register and Login :
On the register page, the user can register by giving common details like First Name, Work Email, Mobile Number, and Password.

If the user is already registered, the user can log in with an Email & Password.

After signup and login successful user is navigated to the dashboard.

## Dashboard:
On the dashboard, the user can have all videos and can refer to the saved template.

After proceeding further user is navigated to a page where he can select the template for creating a new video to proceed further. There are various categories available, users can select from them. Here also users can preview that video by hovering over it.


## Create video page:
After selecting the template, the user will be moved to create a video page where you can make a video by just pasting any blog link or uploading any media, icons, and music.

Once you paste a link or upload any media the ‘convert to video ’ button will get enabled. On the right-hand side you can preview your video and if it looks good user can publish a video.

Once it gets published user can preview and download that video.

## Upgrade:
If the user wants to avail of more features, the user can upgrade its subscription.

After logged in , user is given a basic Community plan. There are 3 more plans: Starter, Professional, and Enterprise.
If the user wants to upgrade, he will be navigated to a payment page, where he has to fill in all the correct details and subscribe to that plan.

After successful OTP confirmation, you will be directed to the success page and from there you can navigate to the dashboard.

## Notes :
All the images and links are used from the original website to get a better experience of the website. I have also included the Github link of our project for your reference.

I would say, thank you for reading this here. I hope you will find it helpful. I and my teammates completed this project with full enthusiasm, focus, and hard work. It may have some bugs, but we will try to fix them soon.

It was not an easy task to implement the new concepts on the first attempt. I would also thank my team members to make this project successful. Feel free to reach out to us for any feedback.
