            <span>
              Content creation bottlenecks swell up when a marketing team relies
              too much on a small group of specialized pros to produce a large
              volume of video content. Instead, put the freedom of video
              creation directly into the hands of all your teams while ensuring
              brand control and watch your content library multiply.

              The most engaging brands are consistent and frequent with their

              doesnâ€™t need to be made from scratch. Lumen5 makes it easy to
              repurpose all of your existing marketing assets and messaging into
              captivating bite-sized videos optimized for online distribution.

              Not every video needs a big budget. While agencies are great for
              your mega high-production campaigns, such as TV commercials,
              brands are turning to Lumen5 to meet the demands of daily or
              weekly video content, purpose-built for social media and corporate
